			<description>Today I modeled a very simple monster (with horrible topology).
He is built from a cube with the multires modifier subdivided 7 times. I sculpted then baked the normals to a 2k map which got placed over the 20kish poly version. The quality is pretty low likely due to the poor UV unwrap.
Once modeled, I made a very simple rig and rigged him up. The movement is pretty terrible because his body shape is so weird, so I&amp;rsquo;ll need to spend some time weight painting if I want it to look good.</description>
